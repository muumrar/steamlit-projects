Having become comfortable with streamlit to a usable degree, I wanted to explore the pydeck extension, as it gives great control over the maps which are displayed (compared to st.map). 

I found pydeck to be rather fragile, but when it worked it produced some good charts.

The dataset contains a locations of properties avaialble for rent in NYC as of February 2022. This data was found online and anonymised for fair usage.
